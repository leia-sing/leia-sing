## Hi there! Iâ€™m Leia ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m a data analyst with experience delivering actionable insights in the travel and technology industries. Most recently, I surfaced insights on business process improvements at Sabre and compliance reporting at Toyota.

Feel free to view my Sabre projects here:
- [Analyzing Rate Competitiveness](https://github.com/leia-sing/Sabre-Internship-Project-Analyzing-Rate-Competitiveness)
- [Program Code Optimization](https://github.com/leia-sing/Sabre-Internship-Project-Program-Code-Optimization)

Feel free to view my Toyota Projects here:
- [Authoring Compliance Software User Management Document](https://github.com/leia-sing/Toyota-Internship-Authoring-User-Management-Documentation)
- [Developing Privacy Reporting Dashboard Prototype](https://github.com/leia-sing/Toyota-Internship-Developing-Compliance-Reporting-Visualizations)

What I enjoy most in my work: 

- Exercising my problem-solving skills when querying data and building visualizations.
- Collaborating with others to understand the bigger picture surrounding my analysis.
- Communicating my insights to foster understanding for stakeholders of all kinds.

Iâ€™m looking for a full-time role where I can continue doing these and more.

When Iâ€™m not working, I love listening to 60s music, dancing, and traveling.
